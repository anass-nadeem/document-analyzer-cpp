Computer Science is the study of computation, algorithms, and information processing.

Data Structure is a method of organizing, storing, and managing data efficiently so that operations such as access, insertion, and deletion can be performed effectively.

Algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or set of rules used to solve a specific problem.

Stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out principle. In a stack, the last element inserted is the first one to be removed.

Queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out principle. In a queue, the first element inserted is the first one to be removed.

Linked List is a dynamic data structure consisting of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference to the next node in the sequence.

Binary Tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

Graph is a non-linear data structure that consists of vertices and edges, used to represent relationships between different entities.

Probability is the measure of the likelihood that a particular event will occur. It is expressed as a number between zero and one.

Statistics is the branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data.

Artificial Intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn.

Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling machines to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.

Deep Learning is a specialized subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers.

In computer science, data structures and algorithms are fundamental concepts that help in writing efficient programs.

A stack is commonly used in function calls, undo operations, and expression evaluation.

A queue is widely used in scheduling algorithms, resource management, and breadth-first search.

Graphs are used in social networks, navigation systems, and recommendation engines.

Probability plays an important role in machine learning, statistics, and data analysis.

Efficient data structures improve the performance and scalability of software systems.
